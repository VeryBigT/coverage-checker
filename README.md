# What's the pursose?
Imagine you play a Pokémon randomizer, nuzzlock challange or some brutal ROM hack. Your main mon has a dark type and a normal type move and you wonder:
- Wich opponents can I hit super effictive?
- Are there mons that can resist both my moves or that are even immune to both?!
- What would be the best combination of types to cover most or even all opposing types?

Those questions and more can be answered by the **P**okémon **C**overage **C**hecker!
The App gives accurate answers for **all gens** (gen 1 to gen 9) and also considers all existing **dualtypes** (also accurate per gen!).
## Coveradge rating
The Coverage of a given combination of types of your available moves is rated with a **point score** and a verdict giving it one of four tier:
- **tier 0**: There are mons, that are immune to all your moves.
- **tier 1**: There are mons, that double resist (x0.25 dmg) all your moves.
- **tier 2**: There are mons, that resist (x0.5 dmg) all your moves.
- **tier 3**: You can hit every mon at least neutral!
- **tier 4**: You can hit every mon **super effictive!!!**

There is also a setting checking whether or not you are covered against this pesky shedninja.
