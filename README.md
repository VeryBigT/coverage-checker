# What's the pursose?
Imagine you play a Pokémon randomizer, nuzzlock challange or some brutal ROM hack. Your main mon has a dark type and a normal type move and you wonder:
- wich opponents can I hit super effictive?
- are there mons that can resist both my moves or that are even immune to both?!
- what would be the best combination of types to cover most or even all opposing types?

Those questions and more can be answered by the **P**okémon **C**overage **C**hecker!
The App gives accurate answers for **all gens** (gen 1 to gen 9) and also considers all existing **dualtypes** (also accurate per gen!).
## Coveradge rating
The Coverage of a given combination of types of your available moves is rated with a **point score** and a verdict giving it one of four tier:
- **tier 0**: there are mons, that are immune to all your moves
- **tier 1**: there are mons, that double resist (x0.25 dmg) all your moves
- **tier 2**: there are mons, that resist (x0.5 dmg) all your moves
- **tier 3**: you can hit every mon at least neutral
- **tier 4**: you can hit every mon **super effictive**
There is also a setting checking whether or not you are covered against this pesky shedninja.
